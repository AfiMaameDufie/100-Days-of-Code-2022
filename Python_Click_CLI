Hiiii :)

Itâ€™s been a while since I put out something. For some reason, I cannot finish some of my drafts but I decided to put together and share something I recently discovered and have been working with.

If you read my previous articles, especially the Progress and Not Perfection, you will realize that I started out with Java Springboot and JavaScript(React) as my focus.

However, things took a little detour and I find myself dabbling in Python and Flask most times.
Turning 180 degrees, we will be taking a look at the Python Click Command.
 
Click is a Python package that provides an awesome and neat way of creating Command Line Interfaces with minimal code.

With Click, there are three main super cool things you can do.

*You can nest commands
*You can create your own help page (--help)
*Lazily loads subcommands during runtime

Let's see an example, shall we?

To write a Python Click CLI tool, 

Prerequisites:
Have Python installed

If you already have a venv setup, you can skip this part.

*To setup the Virtual Environment, 
>>> In your terminal, create a folder for the project
>>>cd into that project 
$ cd myproject
$ pipenv install 
$ pipenv install <package>

Now to activate the shell
$ pipenv shell
$ python --version

//We will install our Click package now
$ pip install Click

You can deactivate the venv with deactivate

Click createsn commands using decorators.
A decorator in Python is a function that takes another function as its argument, and returns yet another function. 

A function becomes a Click command line tool by decorating it through click.command(). At its simplest, just decorating a function with this decorator will make it into a callable script:

import click

@click.command()
def hello():
    click.echo('Hello World!')

    At this point, the decorator converts the function into a Command which then can be invoked:

if __name__ == '__main__':
    hello()

    And what it looks like:
    
$ python hello.py
Hello World!


$ python hello.py --help
Usage: hello.py [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Hiiii :)

Itâ€™s been a while since I put out something. For some reason, I cannot finish some of my drafts but I decided to put together and share something I recently discovered and have been working with.

If you read my previous articles, especially the Progress and Not Perfection, you will realize that I started out with Java Springboot and JavaScript(React) as my focus.

However, things took a little detour and I find myself dabbling in Python and Flask most times.
Turning 180 degrees, we will be taking a look at the Python Click Command.
